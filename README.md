# Mesa.land

Mesa is a NFT card game platform. Turn any NFT collection into a card game
instantly! When you buy a card, you can use it in all your games.

## Contributing

The MVP of mesa runs games in-memory in Deno Deploy. The stack is simple by
declaration:

- [Deno](https://deno.land) for server-side TypeScript.
- [Fresh](https://github.com/lucacasonato/fresh) for JSX components with SSR +
  island hydration.
- [Twind](https://twind.dev/) for styling.
- WebSockets for game state communication. All game moves are events sent on WS.
  State change is calculated server-side and broadcast to all players in the
  game.

That's it â€” for now.

## Desired future - May 2022

- Browse my card gallery
- Create your own cards in user interface
- Mint cards from OpenSea collection
- Use OpenSea cards in new game
- Games stored in FaunaDB
